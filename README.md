## Challenge 1

You are required to build a command line application to estimate the total delivery cost of each package with an offer code (if applicable)

`Delivery Cost = Base Delivery Cost + (Package Total Weight * 10) + (Distance to Destination * 5)`

## Challenge 2

You are required to build a command line application to calculate the estimated delivery time for every package by maximizing no. of packages in every shipment.

## Disclaimers

I used ChatGPT for the following parts of the code:
1. The 0/1 knapsack solver code. I looked up how the 0/1 knapsack problem worked and prompted ChatGPT to generate the algorithm for me in Golang.
2. All tests in this repository was created by pasting the source code into ChatGPT and requesting unit tests.

Other than that, everything else was written by me.
